### Buttons
* place buttons in the 6 button wholes
* solder one leg of each button from the top of the board.
* Flip over board and solder both leds of each button

### IC Socket
* place IC Socket in the holes on the top of the pcb board with the notch towards the word notch
* Hold the IC socket in place and flip over the board, bend out legs in the 4 cornerns.
* Release your hold (socket should stay in place), solder all pins.

### Female headers
* Place the long and short female headers into the top of the board, holding the headers flip over the board and set down on solder table

* place the lcd pins into the longer female header and have the male header go through the 4 holes on the other side of the lcd
* solder the 4 pins to the lcd.


### Battery holder
